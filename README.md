# runBenMAP

A Python script that facilitates running large numbers of BenMAP-CE simulations
on CMAQ output. It builds a set of BenMAP CTLX control scripts and then runs 
BenMAP on each one. It requires a patched version of BenMAP that improves support 
for batch mode. The source is available here from the "batch-mode-updates" branch 
of this repository: https://github.com/pjwilcoxen/BenMAP-CE.
